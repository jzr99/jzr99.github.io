I am a third-year Master student at ETH ZÃ¼rich. My research interests mainly lie in the intersection between computer vision and computer graphics, especially in digital humans and 3D vision.

During my master, I did my semester project on 3D human reconstruction in the AIT at ETH Zurich, supervised by [Chen Guo](https://ait.ethz.ch/people/cheguo), Dr. [Jie Song](https://ait.ethz.ch/people/song), and Prof. [Otmar Hilliges](https://ait.ethz.ch/people/hilliges). Prior to ETH, I did my bachelor's at Beihang University. I was lucky to work with Prof. [Si Liu](https://colalab.net/people) at Beihang University during my gap year.
