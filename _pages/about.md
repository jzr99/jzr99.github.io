I am a first-year DPhil student (generously funded by [Clarendon Scholarship](https://www.ox.ac.uk/clarendon)) at Oxford VGG, supervised by Prof. [Andrea Vedaldi](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/) and Dr. [Iro Laina](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/iro-laina/). I also work closely with Dr. [Chuanxia Zheng](https://chuanxiaz.com/). My research interests mainly lie in the intersection between computer vision and computer graphics, especially in 3D vision. 

During my master study at ETH ZÃ¼rich, I did a research project on 3D human reconstruction, supervised by [Chen Guo](https://ait.ethz.ch/people/cheguo), Dr. [Jie Song](https://ait.ethz.ch/people/song), and Prof. [Otmar Hilliges](https://ait.ethz.ch/people/hilliges). Also, I finished my master thesis "Distilling Neural Fields for Real-time Animatable Avatar Relighting" under the supervision of [Shaofei Wang](https://taconite.github.io/) and Prof. [Siyu Tang](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch/team/Prof-Dr-Siyu-Tang.html). Prior to ETH, I did my bachelor's at Beihang University. I was lucky to work with Prof. [Si Liu](https://colalab.net/people).

<font color=red> I am always happy to collaborate and discuss research with others. So feel free to contact me! </font>
